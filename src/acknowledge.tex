\section*{ACKNOWLEDGMENT}

The preferred spelling of the word acknowledgment in America is without an e after the g. Avoid the stilted expression, One of us (R. B. G.) thanks ...  Instead, try R. B. G. thanks. Put sponsor acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.

References are important to the reader; therefore, each citation must be complete and correct. If at all possible, references should be commonly available publications.
